## 1.0 Executive Summary

Chimera Guardian Arch provides a robust automation layer designed to provision and maintain a hardened Arch Linux workstation. Operating on top of a user-installed, LUKS-encrypted minimal base, this framework programmatically deploys a comprehensive suite of security controls, real-time monitoring capabilities (LKRG, Falco, AIDE), advanced anonymity features (Tor/I2P integration, DNSCrypt), and compartmentalized workflows through virtualization.

Engineered for cybersecurity practitioners, secure software developers, and individuals requiring high-assurance privacy, Chimera delivers a fully configured Hyprland desktop environment alongside a curated stack of professional development and security assessment tools. The framework adheres to a modular, operator-centric architecture, emphasizing maintainability, resilience, and explicit user control over critical security functions. It yields a powerful, customized platform optimized for demanding digital operations.

## üöÄ Quick Installation

This framework **requires** a minimal Arch Linux base system installed on a **LUKS-encrypted** root partition.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://URL_OF_YOUR_REPO/chimera-guardian-arch.git
    cd chimera-guardian-arch
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and **edit it** to set your `CHIMERA_USER` and preferred `THEME`.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    nano .env
    ```
3.  **Run the Main Installation:** This command installs all packages and performs the base system setup.
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
4.  **Perform Manual Steps & Reboot:** Follow the on-screen instructions precisely to configure your Bootloader (GRUB) and `fstab`. Then, reboot the system.
5.  **Finalize the System:** After rebooting and logging in, navigate back to the project directory and run the finalization command. This initializes AIDE and links your configuration files.
    ```bash
    make finalize
    ```
Your Chimera Guardian Arch system is now fully deployed.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Kernel-Level Defense**: Utilizes `linux-hardened` and the **LKRG** module for real-time exploit protection.
* **System Integrity & Firewalling**: Implements **AIDE** for integrity monitoring, `UFW` (ingress) + **OpenSnitch** (egress) for comprehensive network control.
* **Real-time Auditing**: Includes **Falco** + **auditd** for system call monitoring with custom rulesets.
* **Multi-Level Security Posture**: A custom CLI, `guardian-cli` (wrapped by `gdn-*` functions), allows you to instantly switch between operational security profiles defined in YAML (`standard`, `secure`, `paranoid`, `cyberlab`).
* **Advanced Anonymity Suite**: Pre-configured access to both the **Tor** and **I2P** anonymity networks.
* **Encrypted DNS**: System-wide DNS privacy enforced via **DNSCrypt-proxy**.
* **Compartmentalization via Virtualization**: Includes pre-configured profiles (`.conf`) and a universal script (`create-vm.sh`) to instantly deploy isolated Virtual Machines (`disposable`, `work`, `tor`, `cyberlab`).
* **Professional Software Suite**: Pre-installs and configures Neovim (Lua), VS Code, Docker, Postman, Wireshark, KeePassXC, SearchSploit, Metasploit, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Aircrack-ng, Autopsy, and more.
* **Prestige Desktop Environment**: A fully configured **Hyprland** desktop with dynamic theming (`dracula`, `nord`), custom shortcuts, Powerlevel10k prompt, and a suite of "Quality of Life" apps.
* **Automated Maintenance**: Robust `update` function handles OS, AUR, Exploit-DB updates and orphan cleanup, with automatic AIDE baseline regeneration via hooks. Includes versioned backups with encryption support.
* **Professional Framework**: Managed via a central `Makefile`. Features modular scripts with robust error handling (`trap rollback`), centralized logging, script integrity checks (`checksums.txt`), a CI/CD pipeline, and comprehensive documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Commands (via Makefile)

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `make install` | Runs the main system installation (requires sudo). |
| `make finalize` | Runs the post-reboot finalization (requires sudo). |
| `make link` | (Re)creates symbolic links for all configuration files. |
| `make backup` | Creates a versioned, compressed snapshot of your `~/.config` directory. |
| `make update` | Securely updates the entire system (OS, AUR, Exploit-DB). |
| `make healthcheck`| Runs a full system security and status check (requires sudo). |
| `make theme=<name>`| Applies a different theme (e.g., `make theme=nord`). |
| `make rollback` | Restores configurations from the most recent backup. |
| `make logs` | Tails the main installation log file. |
| `make checksums` | Regenerates the script integrity checksums file. |
| `make tui` | Launches the interactive TUI Control Center. |

*(Note: Daily use commands defined in `zsh_functions`, such as `gdn-paranoid`, `aide-check`, `vms`, `safe-browser`, are available directly in your shell after `make finalize`)*
