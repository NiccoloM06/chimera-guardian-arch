## 1.0 Executive Overview

Chimera Guardian Arch is a **post-installation automation framework** for Arch Linux, designed to transform a minimal, encrypted base system into a comprehensive SecureOps environment. This platform is engineered for security professionals engaged in offensive/defensive operations, exploit development, and high-risk daily use.

The framework operates as a layer above a native Arch installation, programmatically applying system hardening, real-time monitoring, advanced compartmentalization, and a curated offensive/defensive toolset. It does not produce a distributable ISO, ensuring the system remains a pure, user-controlled Arch Linux instance.

## 2.0 Core Philosophy

1.  **Security by Architecture:** Defense is multi-layered and integrated into the system's design, not applied as an afterthought.
2.  **Operator Supremacy:** The system's role is to provide clear, actionable intelligence, not to make autonomous security decisions. The human operator remains the ultimate authority.
3.  **Compartmentalized Workflow:** All activities are isolated by default, utilizing virtualization, namespaces, and dynamic network profiles to mitigate risk and prevent cross-contamination.
4.  **Functional Aesthetics:** The user interface is designed for maximum efficiency, readability, and situational awareness, free from non-essential distractions.
5.  **Modular Maintainability:** Every component (configuration, script, theme, rule) is isolated, version-controlled, and replaceable, ensuring long-term maintainability and extensibility.
