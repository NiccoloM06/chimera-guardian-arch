## üöÄ Your First Steps: Post-Installation Checklist

You've completed the installation (`make install`) and finalization (`make finalize`). Excellent work. Now, follow this checklist to make the system truly yours and secure its components.

1.  **Secure Your Virtual Machines:**
    * Launch the "Virtual Machine Manager" (run `vms` in the terminal).
    * Start each VM (`disposable-debian`, `work-debian`, `tor-vm-debian`, `cyberlab-env`) one by one.
    * Open the console for each, log in as `root` with the password `changeme`.
    * **Immediately change the root password** in every VM using the `passwd` command.

2.  **Master the Essential Shortcuts:** Your desktop is a tiling window manager controlled primarily by the keyboard for maximum speed and efficiency. Review the table in the next section.

3.  **Run Your First System Update:** Open a terminal (`Super` + `Enter`) and run the `update` command. This ensures all software is on the latest version and familiarizes you with the maintenance workflow.

4.  **Train Your Firewall:** During the first update or when launching applications that need network access (like Firefox), **OpenSnitch** will prompt you for permission. **Allow** these connections. This is the system learning what normal network activity looks like.

## üì¶ Compartmentalization: Isolating Tasks with VMs

The best security practice is to isolate your activities. Use the `make vm profile=<name>` command to create dedicated environments.

### `disposable-vm` (The Sandbox)
* **Use Case:** Analyzing suspicious files, visiting untrusted websites.
* **Characteristics:** Non-persistent. Resets on every shutdown.
* **Creation:** `make vm profile=disposable`

### `work-vm` (The Vault)
* **Use Case:** Isolated development environment, managing sensitive credentials.
* **Characteristics:** Persistent. Changes are saved.
* **Creation:** `make vm profile=work`

### `tor-vm` (The Cloak)
* **Use Case:** Activities requiring maximum anonymity (sensitive research, etc.).
* **Characteristics:** Persistent. **All traffic** is automatically forced through Tor. Includes a desktop environment with Tor Browser and I2P-configured Firefox.
* **Creation:** `make vm profile=tor` (requires manual setup inside VM on first boot).

### `cyberlab-vm` (The Arsenal)
* **Use Case:** Dedicated environment for offensive security tools and penetration testing.
* **Characteristics:** Persistent. Requires a custom setup script (`vm-profiles/_cyberlab-assets/setup-cyberlab.sh`) to install tools.
* **Creation:** `make vm profile=cyberlab`

Manage your VMs using the **"Virtual Machine Manager"** application (run `vms`).

## üïµÔ∏è The Silent Sentinels: AIDE, OpenSnitch, Falco & LKRG

Your system actively defends itself. Learn to interpret its signals.

### OpenSnitch (The Network Guardian)
* **What it does:** Prompts for permission the first time any program tries to connect to the internet.
* **How to use it:** **Allow** connections only for applications you trust and expect to access the network (e.g., Firefox). **Deny** anything unexpected or suspicious (e.g., `cat` trying to connect to a remote IP).

### AIDE (The File Integrity Guardian)
* **What it does:** Monitors critical system files for unauthorized changes.
* **The Workflow:**
    1.  **Periodic Check:** Run `aide-check` weekly. No output means the system is clean.
    2.  **After System Update:** It's **normal** for `aide-check` to report changed files after running `update`.
    3.  **Update Baseline:** After confirming changes are legitimate, run `aide-update` to accept the new state.
    4.  **Red Flag:** If `aide-check` reports unexpected changes *without* an update, investigate immediately ‚Äì it's a strong indicator of compromise. Refer to `docs/incident_response.md`.

### Falco & auditd (The Syscall Auditors)
* **What they do:** Run in the background, monitoring system calls for suspicious behavior based on predefined rules.
* **How to use it:** You don't interact directly. If Falco detects a high-severity event, the **Guardian Daemon** will notice and potentially trigger an alert (desktop notification or change the Waybar icon color).

### LKRG (The Kernel Guardian)
* **What it does:** Linux Kernel Runtime Guard runs silently, monitoring the kernel itself for signs of exploitation in real-time.
* **How to use it:** You don't need to do anything. If LKRG detects a critical threat, it will print messages to the kernel log (`journalctl -k`) and may trigger an alert via the Guardian Daemon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Maintenance and System Management

Use the `make` targets or the `overlord tui` for system maintenance.

### System Updates
* **Command:** `update` (or `make update`)
* **Actions:** Updates OS packages, AUR packages, Exploit-DB, and cleans orphan dependencies.
* **‚ÄºÔ∏è Mandatory Follow-up:** Always run `aide-update` after every update.

### Configuration Backups
* **Command:** `make backup`
* **Action:** Creates a timestamped, compressed snapshot (`.tar.zst`) of your `~/.config` directory in `~/.chimera_backups/`.

### Configuration Rollback
* **Command:** `make rollback`
* **Action:** Restores your `~/.config` directory from the most recent backup snapshot.

### System Health Check
* **Command:** `make healthcheck`
* **Action:** Runs a comprehensive check of critical security services and system status.
